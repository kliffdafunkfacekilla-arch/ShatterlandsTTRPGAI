I. FOUNDATIONS & COSMOLOGY
The Age of the Primordial Covenant

This was the dawn of civilization, a time defined by the magnificent, ordered mechanism of the Celestial Clockwork—the universal structure of galaxies, solar systems, and planets—and the influence of its first-born race.The Fae: Cousins to Creation

Before the Elder Gods structured the universe, the Fae were born from the raw energy of the Celestial Clockwork itself. They did not wield power; they were power, flowing with the primordial energies of creation. As the cosmos settled and structured itself into the 12 Ability Schools (Force, Bastion, Ki, etc.), the Fae evolved with it, forming 12 distinct sects, each perfectly attuned to one of these powers.

They established their civilization in 12 magnificent, natural grove-cities, each one a potent nexus corresponding to an Ability School. Existing as immortal, mortal-form cousins to the gods, the Fae took on the role of shepherds, guiding the 12 fledgling species of "man" and tirelessly ensuring the world’s fundamental balance.The Rise of the Magistars and the Seeds of Corruption

The species of "man" eventually rose to prominence, led by the 12 Magistars. Each Magister was a brilliant specialist, a master of one of the 12 Ability Disciplines, and they ruled their people based on this profound, specialized knowledge.

However, the Magistars' ambition grew into destructive hubris. Jealous of the Fae’s natural, effortless connection to the primordial power, the Magistars became utterly obsessed with tapping the raw Chaos energy. They descended into true evil, conducting secret studies that included the sacrifice of Fae to dissect and understand the source of their power. This research culminated in the creation of a twisted psychic weapon that could confuse, madden, and corrupt the Fae by turning their own spiritual essence against them—a power to which the Fae had no natural defense.The Treachery of Sh'lar

The corruption was not external alone. The 13th Magister, Sh'lar, was originally a Fae, chosen as their representative in the human counsel. However, she was swayed by the Magistars' seductive promises of power and willingly aided their pursuit of chaos. Using her Fae appearance and wiles to put people at ease and assure them that all was well, she became instrumental in the spiritual subversion that led to the final catastrophe.The Great Exodus

Facing annihilation and the catastrophic corruption of their very being, the Fae resolved upon a desperate measure: a mass exodus. They planned a massive, complex portal ritual that required an immense surge of power to be channeled simultaneously from their 12 sacred groves.

In a final, tragic act, 12 Fae elders willingly remained behind, one in each grove. They sacrificed themselves, becoming living, anti-chaos conduits to generate the necessary energy to fuel the escape portal, allowing the majority of their race to flee the world for an alternate reality or a form of magical space travel. This act of departure, successful though it was for the survivors, created a critical, exploitable weakness in the very fabric of reality—the perfect vulnerability for the Magistars' final, cataclysmic ritual.
The Cataclysm: The Shattering

For a generation, the world was consumed by the War of the Primordial Covenant as the Elder Gods fought against the 12 Magistars, whose increasing mastery of the corrupted power of the Fae made them near-divine threats. This conflict itself bled life and stability from the world.

The Fae's mass exodus, successful for their race, created a critical, exploitable weakness in the very fabric of reality—the perfect vulnerability for the Magistars' final, cataclysmic ritual.
The Final Ritual: The 12 Magistars, jealous of divine power, exploited this weakness. They performed their final, corrupting ritual at the original capital home of the Fae, drawing on the Fae's portal magic. They attempted to tap into the raw Chaos energy of the universe.
The Birth of the Chaos Dragons and the Scouring: The Magistars were consumed by the very chaos they unleashed, transforming themselves into the 13 monstrous Chaos Dragons.
Their forms and methods of destruction are a direct, horrific reflection of the power they sought and the sanity they lost.

The Scourge: Immediately upon their creation, the Dragons went on a cataclysmic rampage that scoured the planet of life. Driven insane by the transformation, they unleashed their specific Brand of Destruction (Signature Chaos), nearly obliterating all species of "man" and all other living things in a horrific, world-ending conflagration.
The 12 Magisters were warped into great beasts, each taking a form and brand of destruction based on their original expertise in the 12 Ability Schools (e.g., Vrak, The Maelstrom Wyrm for Force; Xar, The Clockwork Rot for Cosmos). Each beast was driven utterly insane.
The 13th Magister, Sh'lar, The Prime Corruptor, became an entity that preferred Subtle Entrenchment, not engaging in outright destruction but corrupting the seals themselves.
The Divine Plan and Sacrifice: To save the world from being completely consumed by chaos, the surviving elder gods enacted a desperate, final plan. The most ancient gods, whose power was closest to creation, sacrificed themselves. Their divine energy was used to create a "containment system" to fuel the prisons and the ley lines connecting them.
The Engineer's Task: The Engineer, the youngest of the gods, was charged with the final, solitary step. He gathered the 12 monstrous Chaos Dragons and, using the Fae's abandoned (and magically potent) 12 Sacred Groves as the prison sites, he "placed the stones" and anchored each dragon. He then connected these 12 prisons to the ley lines, funneling the raw chaos from Ground Zero (The Convergence) and stabilizing the world.




The Divine Architecture
The world as it exists today is not a planet in recovery; it is a meticulously engineered, massive-scale containment system. The geography, climate, resource cycles, and even the fate of its inhabitants are all direct consequences of the desperate, final actions taken by the surviving elder gods and the Engineer to prevent the complete unraveling of reality

The Slumbering God: The Engineer's Legacy

Having completed his impossible task of anchoring the 12 Chaos Dragons, The Engineer, the youngest of the gods, did not leave the world; he simply collapsed from exhaustion. His final, solitary act made him an indelible feature of the planet.
The Slumbering Architect: The Engineer came to rest, slumped against the majestic mountain chain that now splits the continent, right near the cataclysmic Convergence (Ground Zero). He slumbers there still, his massive, sleeping form becoming part of the landscape itself:
His head and torso form the Sacred Spire.
His outspread legs and knees form the cliffs and sheltered valley of the Flower Valley Folk.
His arms, resting to either side, form a series of steppes and plateaus, including the Snowspire Citadel plateau, home of the Ursine Hegemony.
The Divine Imprint: The life that grew in this sacred, wooded area—the plants, animals, and eventually humanoids—was profoundly imprinted with the Engineer's final, fading duty: "Guard the prisons." This life evolved into two distinct, yet connected, people: The Wardens and the Gypsy Flocks, who actively train new recruits to fulfill their ancient, often unconscious, charge.
The Species Mosaic: The Rise of the New Kingdoms

The civilizations existing in the current age did not descend from the Ancients ("man") or the Fae. They are the product of immediate, forced adaptation to the planet's scarred state.
Forced Adaptation: The initial cataclysm and the subsequent, corrosive Chaos Zones isolated pockets of surviving wildlife (Mammals, Reptiles, Avians, Insects, etc.). These segregated areas were forced to rapidly adapt to the new world conditions—the chaotic tides, the altered seasons, and the localized corruption bleeding from the nearby Dragon Prisons.
Simultaneous Evolution: This isolation led to thousands of species simultaneously undergoing rapid, divergent evolution, resulting in the many sentient species (Bear-Folk, Lizard-Folk, etc.) that now dominate the Commonwealths. They remained entirely segregated until the invention and wide-scale adoption of Aether-Skiff technology made long-distance travel over the Chaos Zones possible again, beginning the current age of uneasy alliance.
Dragonstone and Lost Knowledge

Survival in this engineered containment system is entirely dependent on manipulating the chaos itself.
Dragonstone Shards: These crystallized fragments of the shattered Celestial Clockwork are the fundamental power source of the Shattered World. They act as power cells for all advanced tech, and critically, they recharge almost instantly upon exposure to a Chaos Zone, making those zones high-risk, high-reward resource points.
Aether-Tech: This specialized technology uses Crystal Resonance via precisely tuned coils and conductors to tap the raw energy stored in Dragonstone Shards, converting the chaotic magical energy into usable kinetic, heat, or electrical force. This guarded knowledge is vital for airships and environmental stabilizers.
Source of Lost Knowledge: The Chaos Zones and the regions near the Engineer's resting place hide the ancient, half-buried ruins of the Ancients and the rarer remnants of the Fae. These sites contain highly advanced Aether-Tech designs, forgotten scientific knowledge, and powerful lost magic.

II. WORLD GEOGRAPHY & PHENOMENA
The Veil of Chaos

The planet is fundamentally defined by the scar tissue of the Cataclysm, a system of corrosive, impassable zones that govern every aspect of life and travel.
Chaos Zones: The world is covered in permanent, corrosive slashes of corruption known as Chaos Zones that separate pockets of non-damaged, stable lands. Long-distance travel by land is impossible, making Airships the most crucial mode of long transport.
Localized Chaos Effects: The Chaos Zones are not uniform. They are defined by the imprisoned Dragon they are closest to. The flavor of destruction (Signature Chaos) the dragon specializes in becomes the strongest effect radiating outwards. For example, a zone near Xar, The Clockwork Rot (Cosmos) may suffer from temporal acceleration or gravity anomalies, while a zone near Igni, The Raging Maw (Evocation) is plagued by unpredictable elemental storms. The overall pattern of these zones mirrors the crack-spread from the original impact points.
The Convergence (Ground Zero): This is the catastrophic impact crater and the center point of the Magistars’ ritual. It contains a permanent, violent storm of chaos, hiding the floating island where the original Fae capital and altar lie. Sh’lar, The Prime Corruptor's influence is strongest here, where her body remains untouched.
Dragonstone Shards (The Resource): These are crystallized fragments of the shattered Celestial Clockwork and the vital resource of the age. They act as power cells for all advanced tech, recharging instantly when exposed to a Chaos Zone, making those zones high-risk, high-reward resource points for specialists and the truly brave.

The Broken Moon & Celestial Calendar

The state of the heavens provides a constant, immense reminder of the world's trauma and dictates the rhythm of all life, culture, and industry.
The Broken Moon-Shard: A neighboring planet, shattered during the Cataclysm, now hangs in the sky as a massive, scarred moon (5x–10x normal size). Its presence is the constant visible sign of the world's trauma.
Chaotic Tides and Seasons: The Moon-Shard's close and elongated orbit causes unpredictable, unstable seasons. Furthermore, the massive gravitational pull has chaotic effects on tides, causing even small ponds and rivers to shift drastically in a daily or weekly cycle, forcing cultures (like the River Folk) to adapt their entire way of life.
The Shadow Week: Several times a year, the orbit causes a massive, week-long eclipse, plunging the world into total darkness. This Shadow Week is a cultural pillar, defining the major rituals (e.g., the Ursine Hegemony’s Rite of Vigilance, the Iron Caldera’s Festival of Life) and philosophical challenges of every civilization.

Airship Logistics

Airships: The Aether-Skiff Economy

The sky is the only reliable highway, and the Aether-Skiff is the vehicle of global commerce, warfare, and survival. The ships fall into two major categories: the unique, master-crafted designs of the Coastal Empire and the mass-produced Standard Skiffs.1. Coastal Empire Shipyards: The Coral-Forges

The Coastal Empire (led by the Cephalopods and Whale-kin) runs the most specialized shipyards in the Shattered World, fusing ancient nautical principles with modern Aether-Tech. Their ships are the global standard for stability and resilience.
Location and Method: Facilities are located on a volcanic island hub, providing both deep-water access and geothermal vents for the intense heat required for metalworking and coil stabilization.
The Coral-Forge Technique: Aquatic master-builders use a unique process where ship hulls are grown from a durable, quick-hardening processed coral and chitin composite rather than wood or sheet metal. This material is lighter and naturally absorbs shock and vibration.
Structural Focus: Their ships feature sleek, whale-like, asymmetrical hulls. This hydrodynamics-influenced design makes Coastal Empire skiffs inherently more stable and resistant to the severe Chaos Turbulence over the zones, giving them the highest Defense rating.
Specialty Exports: Their key exports are highly stable ships specialized for Depth  raids and a stabilized  ship's control nexus.
Crew
Airship crews are the most tightly knit social units in the world, forged by the extreme necessity of survival over the chaotic abyss. Beyond the Captain, every crew is anchored by the Aether-Wright—the master technician responsible for managing the volatile Dragonstone shards and maintaining the Crystal Resonance in the ship’s vital coils—and the Navigator, whose highly specialized expertise guides the vessel through the localized chaos effects of the different Dragon Zones. Success or failure is rarely a single person's burden; it is a profound, shared covenant. To the Free Sky-Barons, the crew is the family, but even among the most cutthroat mercantile guilds, a Captain is nothing without a loyal, cohesive crew, as one single lapse in skill or trust over a Chaos Zone means certain, catastrophic death for all.
2. Standard Aether-Skiffs: The Mass-Produced Fleet

The majority of airships are shorter-ranged, faster-to-produce vessels built from terrestrial materials. They form the backbone of local defense and internal trade but are less stable than the Coral-Forged masters.
Construction: Built using traditional land materials: treated wood, sheet metal from the Scute Confederacy, or chitin/scale-plate provided by the Insectoid or Reptilian kingdoms.
The Coil Problem: Their Aether-Coils are , often using heavy iron cores. This makes them significantly less stable in turbulent air and prone to failure if pushed to full capacity over long distances.
Role: These form the core of the Commonwealth internal trade routes and militia patrols. They are rugged and quick to repair but lack the range or stability of the Coral-Forged ships.
Pirate and Bandit Fleet: The limitations (smaller size, lighter construction, and expendability) make the Standard Skiff ideal for the Free Sky-Baronies and pirate groups. They are modified for bursts of high speed for smash-and-grab operations and are considered expendable due to their cheaper, faster replacement cost.
Coastal Empire Ships (Coral-Forges): These are the hydrodYY/ynamic masters of the skies. They are grown from a durable, shock-absorbing processed coral/chitin composite, giving them superior stability  against Chaos Turbulence.
Standard Aether-Skiffs: These are the mass-produced, terrestrial vessels (wood/metal). They are cheaper, faster to replace, and form the bulk of militia and trade fleets, but their heavy iron coils make them less stable over long distances or through heavy chaos.
Aether-Skiff Classes
The Cargo Caravan: The economy's backbone; a massive, slow ship designed for maximum lift and bulk transport capacity.
The War Skiff: The military's punch; heavily armored and fitted with multiple weapon emplacements for combat and assault operations.
The Scout/Courier: The information network; a small, high-agility vessel designed for maximum speed and stealth reconnaissance.
The Sky-Barque: The status symbol; an ornate, high-efficiency cruiser built for nobility and wealthy merchants.
The Coil-Cutter (Special): A piracy countermeasure; a fast, light vessel equipped with focused forward-coils to project a tight kinetic repulsion field for defense or ramming.
The Deep-Diver (Special): The scientist's vessel; a small, heavily shielded ship designed for stable landing and retrieval operations in the most volatile parts of a Chaos Zone.




III. MAJOR FACTIONS & CIVILIZATIONS

The civilizations that populate the world today are not the heirs of the fallen Ancients, but the children of catastrophe. Their rise defines the Age of Resurgent Sun—a period of uneasy alliance and constant vigilance, defined by the necessity of survival.

The Species Mosaic: A Chaos-Forged Legacy

These diverse peoples did not descend from the Fae or the original species of "man." They are the product of immediate, forced adaptation to the planet's scarred state. The initial cataclysm and the subsequent, corrosive Chaos Zones isolated pockets of surviving wildlife (Mammals, Reptiles, Avians, Insects, etc.). This isolation led to thousands of species simultaneously undergoing rapid, divergent evolution, resulting in the many sentient species (Bear-Folk, Lizard-Folk, etc.) that now dominate the Commonwealths. They remained entirely segregated until the invention and wide-scale adoption of Aether-Skiff technology made long-distance travel over the Chaos Zones possible, beginning the current age of uneasy alliance.

The Engineer's Final Imprint

Furthermore, many of these new kingdoms are subtly guided by the massive, slumbering form of the Engineer. The life that grew in the sacred wooded area near his body—including groups like The Wardens and the Gypsy Flocks—was profoundly imprinted with his final, fading duty: "Guard the prisons." Whether by conscious design or unconscious, instinctual duty, every civilization now plays a part in maintaining the tenuous, fragile containment system that holds the Chaos Dragons at bay. Their cultures, rites, and defenses are all built to defy the specific, localized chaos that surrounds them.
The Ursine Hegemony: The Hearthguard's Vigil
The Ursine Hegemony is not merely a civilization; it is a permanent, organized defiance against the primal entropy of the Shattered World. This society of massive, disciplined bear-folk embodies the principles of order, endurance, and vigilance—a stoic bulwark built directly upon the foundation of the world's savior.I. Geography, The Sleeping God, and The Chaos Threat

The Hegemony’s location dictates its rigid culture. They inhabit the Snowspire Citadel, a colossal fortress built into and upon the high, frozen plateau that forms one of the Engineer's slumbering arms.
The Strategic Position: The Citadel rests immediately adjacent to The Convergence—the "Ground Zero" site of the Cataclysm and a permanent, violent storm of raw, uncontained chaos. This places them in constant proximity to the most potent forms of entropy, particularly the psychic bleed-out from Sh'lar, The Prime Corruptor, and the pure, random destruction of the nearby Grolak, The Unmaking Beast (Chaos).
The Divine Duty: The Ursine, living directly on the Engineer's massive body, have an inherent, almost instinctual connection to the divine imprint: "Guard the prisons." Their entire cultural philosophy is a sophisticated adaptation of this directive, expressed as the pursuit of unyielding order against the chaos.
The Climate of Will: The Citadel's high, frozen climate reinforces their culture. Survival is a constant, shared endeavor against external threats and internal weakness, forcing an absolute commitment to collective strength and Bastion (Endurance).
II. The Hearthguard's Vigil: Culture, Law, and Stability

The core philosophy of the Hegemony is that stable, continuous order is the only true defense against the chaotic randomness of the world. This is encapsulated in the Hearthguard's Vigil.
The Sacred Hearth: The Hearth is more than a fire; it is the physical and magical representation of order. The Citadel maintains a massive, interwoven network of permanent Signal Hearths, each one a magically-stabilized hearth fueled by a Dragonstone Shard. These Hearth-stones are tuned to specifically counteract the localized psychic and temporal distortion from the Convergence, creating stable pockets of reality. A failure in a Hearth is an emergency, as it signifies a localized victory for chaos.
The Bare Necessities: Society eschews frivolity. All laws, trade, and education are devoted to the trinity of survival: defense, warmth, and the next generation. All actions must contribute to the collective goal of stability.
The Dual Providers: The fundamental family unit operates under the Matriarchy (the "Den Mother") and is structured around two equal, revered roles: the External Provider (military, patrols, resource acquisition) and the Internal Provider (crafting, education, maintaining the Hearth System). This redundancy ensures the society's core functions can never be compromised by a single failure.
III. The Global Event: Shadow Week Rite of Passage

The annual seven-day eclipse, The Shadow Week, is the time when the chaos bleed-out is at its most potent and the Hegemony's commitment is truly tested. It is not a holiday, but a perilous, sacred trial.
The Rite of Endurance: The week is the Rite of Passage for all young Ursine. They must leave the Citadel's core and maintain a single, unshielded Signal Hearth on an isolated, high-altitude outpost.
The Test of Will: This test is an endurance challenge against the physical cold and the psychic torment of the Chaos Zones, which are at their peak during the darkness. The young must prove they can endure the madness and maintain the warm, stable order of the Hearth against the constant, whispering entropy of the Dragon influence. Only by successfully maintaining the light and their own composure are they deemed worthy to be full-fledged guardians.
IV. Military and Logistics: The Rampage Doctrine

The Ursine military is a highly disciplined, efficient machine built for decisive, overwhelming force to swiftly re-establish order.
The "Mama Bear" Doctrine: Their military philosophy dictates that threats—both physical and chaotic—must be neutralized instantly and utterly. They do not engage in prolonged warfare unless absolutely necessary, preferring a swift, violent offensive to stamp out the threat before it can destabilize the region.
Rampage Riders: These are the elite military units, masters of Might and Endurance, who pilot the Hegemony's heavily customized War Skiffs.
The Ursine War Skiff: Their War Skiffs are the most heavily armored ships in the known world, utilizing layers of thick Scute-provided metal and specialized Bastion-tuned Aether-Coils. This customization makes them slow, but virtually impervious to mid-level kinetic or elemental attack, embodying the Implacable Siege and Endurance concepts they defend.
Doctrine: The Riders employ a strategy known as Rampage Riding, utilizing focused forward-coils to generate kinetic repulsion fields for shield-bashing or ramming attacks to smash destabilized enemy vessels or breach Chaos Zone strongholds with overwhelming force, rather than engaging in drawn-out tactical duels.
